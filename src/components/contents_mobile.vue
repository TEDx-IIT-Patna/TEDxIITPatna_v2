        Isn't everyone a part of everyone else?  Like every raindrop, a part of the ocean. Like every sand particle, a part of the sand castle.We might think of our achievements and our thoughts to be of our own individual contribution but in the end, they are a sum of every relationship we have made, a string of thoughts we share with every person we meet.We believe that “Together, we are capable of anything!”
The theme of Infinite Affinities speaks for togetherness. It signifies how people on the same journey reach their destination early if they work with harmony and integrity.
